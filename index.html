          <p>
            this website was created in an effort to help local and family owned restaurants, clothing & thrift stores, bakeries, beauty salons, and more in Austin, Round Rock, and more to areas in the future. 
            at the moment, we want to shift our focus to busnesses with black owners.
            we addtionally want to focus on businesses which have been looted.
